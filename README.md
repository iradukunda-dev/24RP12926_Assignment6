Securing CRUD With Session and cookies

Here we first start by creating session
![Creatting session on the user login for book system](<session starting.png>)
![Continued session codes](<session part 2 and logging out.png>) 
![html login form](<login form.png>)
![Session closing(killing)](<clossing session.png>)

I created a default admin user so that the system is only altered by authenticated user
Not public peoples
![Login interface username: admin  password: password123](<login interface-1.png>)
![This is welcome page after logging in the book system](<after logging in-1.png>)
